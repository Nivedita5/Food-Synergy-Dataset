11925486.pdf,Forging Effective Strategies to Combat Iron DeciencyFortication Overcoming Technical and Practical BarriersRichard F HurrellLaboratory of Human Nutrition Institute of Food Science ETHZ Ru schlikon Switzerland CHABSTRACT The main barriers to successful iron fortication are the following  nding an iron compound that isadequately absorbed but causes no sensory changes to the food vehicle and  overcoming the inhibitory effect on ironabsorption of dietary components such as phytic acid phenolic compounds and calcium These barriers have beensuccessfully overcome with some food vehicles but not with others Ironfortied sh sauce soy sauce curry powdersugar dried milk infant formula and cereal based complementary foods have been demonstrated to improve iron statusin targeted populations The reasons for this success include the use of soluble iron such as ferrous sulfate the additionof ascorbic acid as an absorption enhancer or the use of NaFeEDTA to overcome the negative effect of phytic acid,fat,"sugar, milk",enhance,inhibit
11925486.pdf,Thus there are two major technical barriers to overcomewhen developing an ironfortied food The rst is the selection of an iron compound that causes no sensory changes butis adequately absorbed the second is to overcome the inhibitory effect of phytic acid and other food components on ironabsorptionThese barriers can be overcome and ironfortied foods thathave demonstrated an improved iron status in the target population include infant formula  infant cereal  sugar and sh sauce  It is noteworthy that all of these foods wereconsumed with an enhancer of iron absorption  added to overcome absorption inhibitors Currentlyhowever there is little direct evidence that iron fortication ofmajor staple foods such as wheat our or corn our is a usefulstrategy to combat iron deciency,,"sugar, corn, wheat",enhance,inhibit

11925486.pdf,Traditional food processes such as soaking and germinationcan also substantially degrade phytic acid  although anadditional fermentation step is probably necessary for complete degradation  Recently Barclay et al  and Egli used whole wheat whole rye or whole buckwheat assources of phytase to degrade phytic acid in complementaryfoods based on wheatsoy milletcow pea and ricechickpea Itwas possible to degrade phytic acid completely in  to  h byholding the mixture in aqueous solution at the optimum pHand temperature of the phytaseTo summarize the main technical barriers to successful ironfortication are as follows  nding an absorbable iron compound that can be added to the selected food without causingunwanted sensory changes and  overcoming inhibitors ofiron absorption in the food vehicle itself or in the diet withwhich the fortied food is consumed,,"millet, wheat, rice",,inhibit

9701593.pdf, Authentic DDO wasalso very active as an elicitor  Therefore itappears likely that both the elicitor and enhancer activitiesof the crude cucumber cutin hydrolysate are mainly due toDDO This substance does not occur in a free form in thewax fraction and thus appears to represent a true cutinmonomer which is esterified into the polymer but does notoffer further functional groups for ester or ether crosslinkages It should be noted however that DDO likelydoes not represent the only cucumber cutin monomer ofpotential elicitor activity The compounds in band  ofFigure  also exhibit some activity that might result fromthe presence of some hydroxy fatty acids,fat,"pears, cucumber",enhance,
9701593.pdf, The available purelongchain alkanols exhibited a low level of both activities  However a second proximal hydroxyl groupin other alkanols increased their enhancer activity  Therefore it is possible thatthe newly described longchain diols exhibit higheractivities than the corresponding monools In additionsome unsaturated fatty acids are also present in the waxand these compounds exhibit some elicitor activity Therefore it might be that several compounds contribute tothe observed low elicitor activity as well as to the moreprominent enhancer activity of the cucumber surface wax,fat,cucumber,enhance,
9701593.pdf,The structural features of oxygenated hydrocarbons thatare important for HO elicitation in the cucumber hypocotyl system became only partly clear with the selection ofauthentic compounds used in this study In saturated fattyacids at least one hydroxyl group is required  for activity preferentially located at thevposition  Alternatively cisdouble bondsare favorable  Inthis respect our results are in agreement with the observation that arachidonic acid  can elicit several defense responses in potato  Hydroxyl and epoxy groups in some cases enhancebut in others decrease elicitor activity of fatty acids depending on their number and relative position ,fat,"potato, cucumber",enhance,
9701593.pdf, The abovementioned HO elicitorenhancers are lipophilic molecules and therefore mightexert their action at the level of membranebound constituents of the HOeliciting system Because a comparatively broad array of compounds was found active a possible mode of action may be a change in the lipidneighborhood of either the receptors for the three chemically different elicitors or the plasma membranelocatedNADH oxidase complex assumed to be responsible forreducing O It has been demonstrated that fungal pathogens can secrete cutinases during early stages of the germination process  It remains controversial andmay depend on the actual case studied whether the cutinases secreted indeed represent essential fungal virulencefactors  Nevertheless the presence of cutinases inthe attacked surface area is likely to result in the production of free cutin monomers and it appears likely thatcutinases or similar unspecific esterases will also liberatethe DDO esterified to cucumber cutin,,"pears, cucumber",enhance,
